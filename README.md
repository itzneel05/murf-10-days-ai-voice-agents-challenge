# Day 1 Challenge - Murf AI Voice Agents Challenge

I have completed **Day 1** of the Murf AI Voice Agents Challenge! You can see my detailed conversation and progress on my [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/neel-ijner_murfaivoiceagentschallenge-10daysofaivoiceagents-activity-7397938370200461312-drcp?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAE5WuWABgUWAz075WSV6OLBqrioIn-4G82U).

For this challenge, I utilized [Google AI Studio's API gemini-2.5 flash], leveraging its powerful capabilities to kickstart my voice agent development.

Additionally, my voice agent is powered by the fastest TTS API—**Murf Falcon**—which delivers human-like, real-time speech synthesis to make interactions seamless and natural.

I am proud to be part of the **Murf AI Voice Agent Challenge**, where developers explore cutting-edge voice agent technologies to build innovative applications.


# Day 2 - Coffee Shop Barista Voice Agent

For Day 2, I transformed my starter agent into a friendly coffee shop barista that can take voice orders step-by-step.

- Asks for the customer’s name if not known  
- Takes coffee order details: drink type, size, milk preference, and extras  
- Confirms the full order with the customer  
- Saves the order in a JSON file for easy tracking  
- Updated Murf TTS voice and instructions to fit the barista persona

- Uses past data to guide next conversations

# Day 4 - Teach-the-Tutor: Active Recall Coach

For Day 4, I built an active recall coach voice agent that helps users learn by teaching back concepts.

- The agent supports three modes:  
  - Learn: explains a concept (voice: Matthew)  
  - Quiz: asks questions (voice: Alicia)  
  - Teach Back: asks user to explain and gives feedback (voice: Ken)  

- Uses a small JSON content file with concepts to guide learning  
- Users can switch modes anytime by voice

# Day 5 - Simple FAQ SDR + Lead Capture Voice Agent

For Day 5, I built a Sales Development Representative (SDR) voice agent for an Yellow AI. This agent:  

- Greets visitors warmly and asks about their needs  
- Answers common company/product/pricing questions using a prepared FAQ JSON  
- Collects lead details naturally during the conversation (name, company, email, role, use case, team size, timeline)  
- Stores lead info and generates a summary at the end of the call in a JSON file

# Day 6 - Fraud Alert Voice Agent

Built a fraud detection voice agent for a fictional bank that:

- Loads fake fraud cases from a JSON database at call start  
- Verifies user identity with a simple security question  
- Reads out suspicious transaction details (merchant, amount, masked card, time, location)  
- Asks if the user made the transaction  
- Updates database status: `confirmed_safe`, `confirmed_fraud`, or `verification_failed`  
- Ends call with action confirmation (card blocked/new card issued/dispute filed)

# Day 7 - Smart Food & Grocery Ordering Agent

Built an intelligent grocery ordering voice agent that:

- Uses a 20+ item catalog (groceries, snacks, prepared foods)  
- Adds items to cart with quantities and confirms changes  
- Handles smart requests like "ingredients for peanut butter sandwich" (adds bread + PB automatically)  
- Supports cart operations: add, remove, update, list contents  
- Saves complete order (items, quantities, total, timestamp) to JSON when done  


Powered by the fastest Text-to-Speech API — **Murf Falcon** — providing smooth, natural voice interactions.

Excited for the upcoming days as I continue building and refining more intelligent and responsive voice agents with Murf AI's advanced ecosystem!
