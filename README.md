# Day 1 Challenge - Murf AI Voice Agents Challenge

I have completed **Day 1** of the Murf AI Voice Agents Challenge! You can see my detailed conversation and progress on my [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/neel-ijner_murfaivoiceagentschallenge-10daysofaivoiceagents-activity-7397938370200461312-drcp?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAE5WuWABgUWAz075WSV6OLBqrioIn-4G82U).

For this challenge, I utilized [Google AI Studio's API gemini-2.5 flash], leveraging its powerful capabilities to kickstart my voice agent development.

Additionally, my voice agent is powered by the fastest TTS API—**Murf Falcon**—which delivers human-like, real-time speech synthesis to make interactions seamless and natural.

I am proud to be part of the **Murf AI Voice Agent Challenge**, where developers explore cutting-edge voice agent technologies to build innovative applications.

Excited for the upcoming days as I continue building and refining more intelligent and responsive voice agents with Murf AI's advanced ecosystem!
